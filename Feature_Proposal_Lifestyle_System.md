Title: College Athlete Lifestyle & Routine Management System

Overview:
The College Athlete Lifestyle & Routine Management System introduces daily life management into the college football experience. Instead of athletes developing only through practices and games, their performance now depends on their full lifestyle routine, including sleep habits, workout schedules, social activities, nutrition, and time management. Every athlete follows a weekly routine that the user can influence, creating a deeper and more realistic simulation where personal habits directly affect on-field performance.

Value Statement:
This feature brings authenticity to the game by acknowledging that real college athletes are shaped not only by training sessions, but also by how they live. The system reinforces the idea that success comes from consistency, discipline, and balance rather than raw talent alone. It increases emotional connection to players because users see them as individuals with lives beyond the football field. It also adds strategic decision-making: maintaining good habits improves performance, while overtraining or unhealthy routines introduce realistic risks such as fatigue, burnout, stress injuries, or conflicts with coaches and teammates.

Solution:
Each athlete receives a routine schedule consisting of wake-up time, meals, weight room sessions, practice intensity, rest periods, academic hours, and optional social or recreational activities. Users can adjust these routines using presets (Balanced, Highly Disciplined, Aggressive Training, Relaxed) or create custom schedules. Athlete traits (motivated, lazy, party-focused, disciplined, workaholic) influence how closely they follow their routines. Good lifestyle habits increase morale, stamina, focus, and season-long development, while poor habits can lead to exhaustion, injuries, declining performance, or decreased coach trust. Weekly “Lifestyle Report Cards” summarize sleep quality, energy levels, nutrition, and training intensity to help users adjust schedules without micromanaging every detail.

Evaluation Statement:
The system provides major advantages: higher realism, deeper player progression, and stronger narrative connection as users watch athletes grow through discipline or struggle through bad choices. It creates meaningful trade-offs — pushing athletes too hard may lead to short-term gains but long-term burnout, while a perfectly balanced routine supports steady improvement. A possible concern is that some users might find lifestyle management overwhelming. To solve this, presets and automation options allow casual users to skip lifestyle micromanagement, while players who enjoy deeper management can control the full system. Overall, the College Athlete Lifestyle & Routine Management System adds life-simulation complexity in a way that enhances immersion, strategy, and emotional impact.
